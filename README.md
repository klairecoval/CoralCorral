### Research
- Starfish - Starfish are spiny, hard-skinned animals that live on the sea floor. They move slowly along the sea bed, using hundreds of tiny tube feet.
- Pufferfish - The Pufferfish is called the pufferfish because when it is threatened, it puffs up to about twice its normal size by gulping water.
- Octopus - Octopuses are eight-armed animals that live on the ocean floor. An octopus has an eye on each side of its head and has very good eyesight, but it can't hear.
- Crab - Crabs are 10-legged animals that walk sideways. Most crabs live in the oceans, but many can live on land.
- Jellyfish - Jellyfish have soft bodies and long, stinging tentacles that they use to catch fish. A jellyfish is 98% water.
